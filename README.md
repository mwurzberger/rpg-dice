About
=====
This library was built to address a pair of issues. Bettern randomization of die rolls in JavaScript and the ability to have many many die systems easliy extended.

To deal with the randomization isssue a library implementing http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Twister is used. https://github.com/pigulla/mersennetwister

To deal with the second issue all rolls are returned as JSON.
